## If You Built Your Own

To build your own distributed system you'd need to:

- pick a suitable cloud provider
- provision hardware or resources to suit
- automate deployment of software
- distribute tests to multiple machines
- aggregate results in real time
- build a time series database for results
- script a test control system
- tune OS and JVMs to meet your test requirements

All this before you even get some runs on the board.
