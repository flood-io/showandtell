## Tool Agnostic

> We built a system that's tool agnostic.

Today we choose open source tools such as JMeter, Gatling and Selenium. Tomorrow we can choose another. We're always on the lookout for the best of breed tools.

We don't mind which tool is the best. We focus instead on building a real time reporting system with 15 second granularity on top.
